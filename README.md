### Broken Access Control  
#### Vulnerabilities
- Insecure ID Vul  
- Path Traversal Vul  
- File Permission Vul  
#### Attack  
- Apply gobuster to the server to see what file and directory are subject to the eyes of outer world. The wordlist is located in https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/spring-boot.txt
- Traverse the list of contents on the URL bar based on three roles, not-login, login user and admin.  
- The goal is to get the file permission of access to credential files in the server.

### Injection
#### Attack
- SQL Injection
#### Action
- Apply SQL Injection on the target and see what record can be extracted from DB
- Modify Java code so it prevents SQL Injection

### Insecure Design
#### To Be Editted

### Security Misconfiguration
#### Action
- Review the config files of Backend Environment(Postgres and Spring Boot)
- Check if any error message is accessible to users

### Vulnerable and Out-dated Components
#### Action
- Review the components of Frontend and Backend
